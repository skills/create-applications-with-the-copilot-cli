## Step 2: Generate a Node.js CLI Calculator App

- ✅ Used the `copilot` command for interactive AI-assisted development
- ✅ Generated code for a Node.js CLI calculator app with Copilot CLI
- ✅ Implemented basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- ✅ Created tests for the calculator functions
- ✅ Committed and pushed changes to your development branch

## Step 3: Expand Calculator Functionality

- ✅ Practiced iterative development by expanding the calculator with new features
- ✅ Created a second issue for additional calculator operations
- ✅ Added modulo, exponentiation (power), and square root functions
- ✅ Implemented error handling for edge cases
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for new operations
- ✅ Experienced collaborative coding on the command line with AI assistance

## Step 4: Create, Review, and Merge Your Pull Request

- ✅ Created a pull request directly from the Copilot CLI
- ✅ Added Copilot as a reviewer for code quality feedback
- ✅ Linked the pull request to both the calculator issues
- ✅ Reviewed pull request status and linked issues from the CLI
- ✅ Merged the pull request using a squash merge strategy
- ✅ Automatically closed both issues upon merge
- ✅ Completed the entire development lifecycle from command line
